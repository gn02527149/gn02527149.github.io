    <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
        <ol>
            <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
            <li>Magic City, ID</li>
            <li> Bountiful, UT</li>
            <li>Last Chance, CO</li>
            <li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
            <li> Why, AZ</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>July 14, 2012</h3>
    <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
        <blockquote>"Passing cars,
            <br> When you can't see,
            <br> May get you,
            <br> A glimpse,
            <br> Of eternity."</blockquote>
        I definitely won't be passing any cars.</p>

    <p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
        <ul>
            <li>cellphone</li>
            <li>iPod</li>
            <li>digital camera</li>
            <li>protein bar</li>
        </ul> Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said,
        <blockquote>"A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."
